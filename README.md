# TechTalks: Portfolio Optimization Workshop
Thse are Python scripts that were used in a Portfolio Optimization Workshop hosted by the Rotman Commerce FinTech Association. These scripts were created and ammended using several online resources. To make this script operational, you will need to specify a QUANDL API Key and an API and Secret Key from the Alpaca Inc. Brokerage for your respective account. 

These scripts are based on the Monte Carlo Simulation. Based on the assumptions in that model, the scripts generate the optimal portfolio based on several metrics. The scripts then rebalance the portfolio in the specified Alpaca Account. 

These data, figures, and other sources of information provided by the scripts are approximate and provided for informational purposes only. These scripts are intendly strictly for educational purposes and only a paper trading Alpaca account should be used. I am not liable for any damages thay may occur in the event that one makes trading/financial decisions based on the results of these scripts.
